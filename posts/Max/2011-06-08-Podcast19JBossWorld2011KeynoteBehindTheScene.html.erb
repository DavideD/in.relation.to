<p class="wikiPara">
This time we are doing a very special episode of the Asylum podcast. 
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
To understand the podcast it is good to have seen the <a href="http://vimeo.com/24798138" target="" class="regularLink">video of the keynote</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
It gives a rare view behind the scenes of how the team behind the JBoss World 2011 Keynote created and made the whole demo work.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Emmanuel and I recorded the podcast in his hotel room in Boston during JBoss World together with Manik Surtani, Jay Balunas, Jason Greene, Mike Brock and Sanne Grinovero. 
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
It's filled with a lot of jokes and laughter and in between a lot of good technical content about the keynote and even some glimpses into how it is to be a developer in and at JBoss/Red Hat. 
</p>
