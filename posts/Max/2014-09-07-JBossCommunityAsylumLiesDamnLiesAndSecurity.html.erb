This time around we are talking with David Jorm and Arun B. Neelicattu about Security, especially around Java.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We get to hear about how climate change helped improve JBoss, all about the secret societies surrounding security and how all software is basically doomed - but also learn how you can improve security for your framework(s) and application(s).
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
Listen in if you care about security and want to learn more, but also if you don't think you care - you might learn a few things. I know I did.
