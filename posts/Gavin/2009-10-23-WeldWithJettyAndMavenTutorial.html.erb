Steven Boscarine has written a <a href="http://info.rmatics.org/2009/10/17/jsf2_tutorial_0/" target="" class="regularLink">nice short tutorial</a> on getting up and running with Weld and JSF on Jetty, using Maven. Note that there's a bit more boilerplate here than there would be in a Java EE environment, since integration of Weld in Jetty requires explicit configuration. Nevertheless, I think Steven does a good job of demonstrating that it's easy to get up and running with this stuff.

UPDATE: Steven has extended the tutorial to cover <a href="http://info.rmatics.org/2009/10/24/jsf2_tutorial_0b/" target="" class="regularLink">deployment to Tomcat</a>.</p>
