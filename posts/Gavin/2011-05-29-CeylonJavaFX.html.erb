I can't wait to try my hand at creating a Ceylon wrapper for <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/opinali/archive/2011/05/28/javafx-20-beta-first-impressions" target="" class="regularLink">JavaFX 2</a>. The Ceylon language was <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/IntroductionToCeylonPart9" target="" class="regularLink">designed with this kind of problem in mind</a>. And JavaFX was originally designed for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/visage/" target="" class="regularLink">a language with some of the same ideas in it as Ceylon</a>. Damn, better get back to work on that damn compiler I keep promising...
