The <a href="http://jboss.org" target="" class="regularLink">jboss.org team</a> has posted <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/file-access/default/members/jbosslabs/freezone/podcasts/King_JavaOne2007.m4v" target="" class="regularLink">video of an interview</a> we did at JavaOne this year. Well, I hope it's interesting, I think I come off a bit too /easygoing/ at first, and what is up with that limp wrist? Apparently I'm in need of some masculinity training!</p>
