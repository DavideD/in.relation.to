<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tsurdilovic/applying-drools-in-assistive-technology">Here</a> are the slides for my talk at this years JUDCon in Berlin. I was unfortunately not able to make it there in person, however Skype worked out great. Having to get up at 4am to test the connection was the hardest part ;) </div>

<p class="wikiPara">
The main topic of the talk was on how to apply Drools in Assistive Technology which is considered a <q>non-typical</q> technology field. It shows some of my past research and work in the area of assistive mouse-cursor control and shows how Drools as a fully fledged integration platform can further enhance the overall needs of current assistive technology devices and systems now and in the future.
