<p class="wikiPara">
For those of you tracking Seam 3 releases and bug fixes, you might have seen <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SEAM-99" target="" class="regularLink">SEAM-99</a> was fixed with Seam 3.1.0.CR1 we released last week. I just discovered a small gotcha when using non-JTA transactions. If you are, your EntityManager must <i class="wikiEmphasis">not</i> be scoped <tt>@ConversationScoped</tt> or it will fail on every request.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We prefer JTA and hope the majority of our users do as well, but some may choose to simply use transactions from the <tt>EntityManager</tt>, which is fine too. Just be aware of that little gotcha if you are not using JTA.</p>
