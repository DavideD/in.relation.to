We just published Hibernate Search version `5.8.0.Beta1`, which is now
compatible with Elasticsearch versions `5.x`.

== New improved Elasticsearch client

This release now uses the new Elasticsearch REST client, which is expected to
be a safe choice in terms of long term maintenance as it's sponsored and
recommended by the Elasticsearch team.

Compared to the driver we used previously, this one uses a state of the art
reactive architecture, so we can take advantage of more efficient resource
utilization.

== Elasticsearch 2.x is still supported

The new driver is backwards compatible, so we'll still be able to connect to
clusters running Elasticsearch `2.x`.

This doesn't need any configuration flag as Hibernate Search can automatically
detect the version of Elasticsearch it's being pointed to.

The features supported by Elasticsearch `5.x` and `2.x` are however slightly
different and you'll find that some low level mapping features are documented
as compatible with only one specific version.

The migration guide will be updated when this minor release will be feature
complete.

== New `Simple Query String` supported by the Query builder DSL

The useful capabilities from Lucene's `SimpleQueryParser` are now conveniently
exposed by our higher level DSL.

We'll publish a detailed blog about this new feature soon: stay tuned!

If you can't wait, we won't prevent you from peeking into the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.8/reference/en-US/html_single/#_simple_query_string_queries[Simple Query String documentation].

== Simplified JNDI configuration

If you integrated any external component into Hibernate Search using JNDI,
for example a JMS queue or an Infinispan cache, this configuration was simplified.

You will no longer need to set Hibernate Search specific configuration
properties such as how to set the `InitialContext` for JNDI lookups:
only configure Hibernate ORM, and Hibernate Search will inherit the same
settings.

See also the http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.2/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#jndi[JNDI configuration in the Hibernate ORM documentation].

== How to get these releases

All versions are available on Hibernate Search's https://hibernate.org/search/[web site].

Ideally use a tool to fetch it from Maven central; these are the coordinates:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-orm</artifactId>
   <version>5.8.0.Beta1</version>
</dependency>
----
====

To use the experimental Elasticsearch integration you'll also need:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-elasticsearch</artifactId>
   <version>5.8.0.Beta1</version>
</dependency>

Downloads from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/[Sourceforge] are available as well.
