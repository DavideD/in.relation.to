After two candidate releases and a bit of quiet time in waiting for Hibernate ORM 5.0.0.Final,
we now published `Hibernate Search 5.4.0.Final`: the first stable release compatible with ORM 5.

== Minimal API changes

This version is designed to minimize your work to upgrade the Hibernate stack,
so that you can focus on the changes needed to get running with Hibernate ORM 5
without having to deal with changes in the Search API.

== Plans for WildFly 10, Lucene 5

WildFly 10 is coming fast and will feature both Hibernate ORM 5 and Hibernate Search, so please
take advantage of this `Hibernate Search 5.4.0.Final` release as a milestone to get your applications up to date.

In WildFly 10 however we plan to include a further evolved version of Hibernate Search, to also update Apache Lucene to the latest (currently Lucene 5.3).

So the plan is that we'll include some evolution of Hibernate Search 5.5.x in WildFly 10,
but upgrading both ORM and Lucene could be a lot of changes for you to face in one sprint
so I highly recommend using this version `5.4.0.Final` as an intermediate, reliable refactoring step.

== Other improvements

Since the main mantra for this version was "don't change anything" (except the Hibernate ORM version),
the new and cool stuff will be coming in the next minor release.

Of course we also fixed some minor bugs; the most relevant ones are in the area of the Query DSL,
improving the handling of null-tokens during query generation and better recognition of Numeric Fields.

For details, see:

* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1981[HSEARCH-1981] QueryBuilder should not tokenize the null-token when searching for null
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1973[HSEARCH-1973] Make sure the metadata recognizes a field as Numeric even if it's wrapped into a NullEncodingTwoWayFieldBridge
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1968[HSEARCH-1968] Avoid the NPE on empty results during a Faceting Query

Special thanks to Marcel Barbosa Pinto for identifying and fixing the NPE on Faceting queries!
