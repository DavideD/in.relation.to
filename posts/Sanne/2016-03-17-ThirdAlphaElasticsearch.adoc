Having fixed several issues and tasks since the previous milestone, it's time to publish our third milestone
towards Elasticsearch integration: Hibernate Search version 5.6.0.Alpha3 is now available!

== Migration from Hibernate Search 5.5.x

Even if you're not interested in the new Elasticsearch support, you might want to try out this version as
it benefits from Apache Lucene 5.5.0.

If you ignore the new features and want to simply use Lucene in embedded mode the migration is easy,
and as usual we are maintaining notes regarding relevant API changes in the
https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/5.6/[Migration Guide to Hibernate Search 5.6].

== Elasticsearch support progress

 - you can now use the Analyzers from Elasticsearch
 - Multiple operations will now be sent to Elasticsearch as a single batch to improve both performance and consistency
 - Spatial indexing and querying is now feature complete
 - We'll wait for Elasticsearch to be "green" before attempting to use it at boot
 - Many improvements in the query translation
 - Error capture and reporting was improved
 - the Massindexer is working now, but is not yet using efficient bulk operations
 - the Elasticsearch extensions are now included in the WildFly modules

== How to get this release

Everything you need is available on Hibernate Search's https://hibernate.org/search/[web site].

Get it from Maven Central using the above coordinates.

Downloads from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/5.6.0.Alpha3/[Sourceforge] are available as well.
