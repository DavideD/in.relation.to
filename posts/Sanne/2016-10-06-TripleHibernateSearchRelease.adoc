Today we have three releases of Hibernate Search!

I'm proud to announce our team is a bit larger nowadays, and more contributors are volunteering too, so we managed to increase the development pace. Today we release version `5.6.0.Beta3`, `5.7.0.Alpha1` and `5.5.5.Final`.

Version 5.6.0.Beta3:: the latest version of our main development branch, with experimental Elasticsearch integration.

Version 5.7.0.Alpha1:: essentially the same as `5.6.0.Beta3`, but compatible with Hibernate ORM version `5.2.x`.

Version 5.5.5.Final:: a maintenance release of our stable branch.

== A 5.7 preview released when 5.6 isn't out yet?

Let me explain this unusual decision was taken to accomodate for the needs of you all.

The `5.6` series is creating a lot of anticipation with the Elasticsearch integration being a very welcome new feature; it's meant to be an experimental new feature as we won't break our APIs yet while all integration needs are analyzed, still it's taking a bit longer than expected and even though it's and experimental feature we don't want to rush it and need to finish it up properly.

In the meantime the Hibernate ORM project released a series `5.2.x`, and several users have been asking to get an Hibernate Search version compatible with it. We could not upgrade our `5.6` series yet, as then people using an older Hibernate ORM would not be able to play with the Elasticsearch integration.

So now that `5.6` is in good shape - we decided the next release will be a candidate release - we felt we could already publish a `5.7` version, which is just exactly the same but in a new branch made compatible with the very latest Hibernate ORM.

== How is the Elasticsearch integration coming?

It's maturing at high speed. The biggest obstacles have been resolved, so we definitely look out for more feedback at this point; as mentioned, the next version will be a candidate release.

Hibernate Search now has a proper *Sorting API*: watch this space as we'll publish a dedicated blog about it, or get a peek at the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.6/reference/en-US/html_single/#query-sorting[query sorting] paragraph in the documentation.

This is an important milestone, as it makes sorting queries on Elasticsearch possible through our DSL.

== How to get these releases

All versions are available on Hibernate Search's https://hibernate.org/search/[web site].

Ideally use a tool to fetch it from Maven central; these are the coordinates:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-orm</artifactId>
   <version>5.6.0.Beta3</version>
</dependency>
----
====

To use the experimental Elasticsearch integration you'll also need:

====
[source, XML]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-elasticsearch</artifactId>
   <version>5.6.0.Beta3</version>
</dependency>
----

Downloads from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/[Sourceforge] are available as well.
