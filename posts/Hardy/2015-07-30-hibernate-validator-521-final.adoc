I know you have been waiting in anticipation, but now it is available -
Hibernate Validator 5.2.1.Final :-). Given that it is a drop-in replacement for
all 5.x releases, there is no reason to delay an upgrade. Just go and
<<get-it, get it>>.

For the more cautious, here again the highlights of the 5.2 release with
pointers to more information.

[[highlights]]
== The highlights

* Java 8 Support, most notably the ability to validate `Optional` and the new
  date/time types. Types, which do not represent an instant on
  the time-line, however, are not supported out of the box. This includes,
  for example, `LocalDate` and its sub-types. Semantically it does not make
  sense to talk about future and past, if your data type cannot be
  unambiguously tied to an instant in time. This is still a bit of a open
  discussion (see link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-981[HV-981]) though.
  <<contact,Contact us>> if you have an opinion. +
+
Support for Java 8 also includes the use of type annotation constraints like:
+
[source,java]
----
private List<@AcmeEmail String> emails;
----
+
In this case each element of the `emails` list (or more generally of any `Iterable`)
will be validated using the `@AcmeEmail`. Note the use of a custom constraint and not
the Hibernate Validator provided `@Email`. The reason is that all provided constraints
are missing `java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE` in their definition for now.
Adding it would break backwards compatibility to Java 6.
+
[NOTE]
====
Java 8 is not a requirement for Hibernate Validator 5.2. It
is still backward compatible with Java 6. Java 8 specific features are only
enabled in case a Java 8 runtime is detected.

* Ability to provide custom constraints discoverable
  via the Java link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html/[ServiceLoader] mechanism.
  Under the hood this uses the new `ConstraintMappingContributor` SPI.

* Ability to use Hibernate Validator without dependency to the Expression
  Language libraries by using the new `ParameterMessageInterpolator`.

* Ability to provide an external `ClassLoader`. Potentially handy for
  modularized environments. link:/2015/02/24/hibernate-validator-520-beta-1-a-joint-effort/#H-AbilityToProvideExternalClassLoader[read more...]

* Apache Karaf feature file.

* Extension of the
  link:http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/beanvalidation/spec/1.1/api/javax/validation/Path.html[Path API]
  for nodes of type `ElementKind.PROPERTY`, which allows to obtain the value
  of the represented property.

* Tons of bug fixes

[[get-it]]
== Where to get it
Maven artifacts can be found in the link:http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/org/hibernate/hibernate-validator/5.2.1.Final/[JBoss Maven] repository, as well as in link:http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|org.hibernate|hibernate-validator|5.2.1.Final|jar[Maven Central]. The GAV is _org.hibernate:hibernate-validator:5.2.1.Final_.
Distribution bundles will be uploaded to
link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/5.2.1.Final[SourceForge] once it has recovered from its link:http://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-infrastructure-and-service-restoration-update-for-728[storage fault].

[[whats-next]]
== What's next

Further development will be driven by the upcoming Bean Validation update -
Bean Validation 1.2. Most likely this will align with a Hibernate Validator 6
requiring Java 8. This will be necessary to make use of all the new features
Java 8 offers, amongst others the use of
`link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/repeating.html[@Repeatable]`.
This is in alignment with other technologies which are part of the Java EE 8
standard.

Watch for changes to the Hibernate Validator

as well as announcements on this and the
link:http://beanvalidation.org[Bean Validation] blog.

pass:[*] In case you are wondering what happened with 5.2.0.Final, it became obsolete while waiting for SourceForge to recover. In the meantime an IBM JVM specific issue (link:https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1007[HV-1007]) was reported and fixed.
