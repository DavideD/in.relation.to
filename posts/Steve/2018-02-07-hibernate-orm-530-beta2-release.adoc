This is the second Beta release in the Hibernate ORM 5.3 family.  5.3 represents a JPA 2.2 compatible version
on top of 5.2.  Beta2 is mainly minor bug-fixes and improvements.  Changes of note include:

* Move to Bintray for artifact publishing.  This move has been long-planned, and we finally were finally able to implement it.  From Bintray the artifacts are synced to both JCenter and Maven Central.
* New https://agroal.github.io/[Agroal]-based `ConnectionProvider`
* The issues with documentation uploading have been resolved, so documentation for 5.3 is now available from the doc server.  See the ORM https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/5.3/[documentation] page.
