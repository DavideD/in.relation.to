This is a first Beta release in the Hibernate ORM 5.3 family.  5.3 represents a JPA 2.2 compatible version
on top of 5.2 which includes the changes discussed below.

See Jira for the complete list of https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/31612/tab/release-report-all-issues[changes]

See the https://hibernate.org/orm/releases/[downloads] page for details on obtaining this release

__NOTE : we have been having trouble getting documentation uploaded to the JBoss doc server.  So the documentation
may not be available online at this time.  In that case, the documentation can be obtained from the
release bundles from SourceForge.  See the https://hibernate.org/orm/releases/[downloads] page

== JPA 2.2 features

=== CDI-hosted AttributeConverters

Starting in JPA 2.1 applications could use CDI-hosted beans as entity event listeners.  JPA 2.2 extends
that support to allow AttributeConverters to be CDI-hosted beans as well.

To facilitate this, we have developed a generic interface that allows access to any kind of bean hosted in
any type of DI/bean container.  The contract for integrating such bean containers is
`org.hibernate.resource.beans.container.spi.BeanContainer`.  Hibernate comes with implementations
of `BeanContainer` for integrating with CDI; we have also tested adapting it to Spring container. Generally
speaking, Hibernate accesses `BeanContainer` though its `org.hibernate.resource.beans.spi.ManagedBeanRegistry`
service which hides some of the repetitive details of dealing with `BeanContainer` based on Hibernate's normal
usage.

Applications would normally not access the `BeanContainer` nor the `ManagedBeanRegistry`.  Integrators
however might want to use them to leverage Hibernate integration with these back-end containers.
`ManagedBeanRegistry` is a service and can be accessed from the SessionFactory's ServiceRegistry.
The `BeanContainer` can be accessed from there via `ManagedBeanRegistry#getBeanContainer` (which
may return null).


=== Support for repeating annotations

JPA 2.2 defines support for repeating annotations (`@java.lang.annotation.Repeatable`).  This includes the addition
of `@TableGenerators` and `@SequenceGenerators`.  All other JPA annotations already had "containing" annotations.



=== Query result streaming

JPA 2.2 adds `Query#getStream` to support streaming of the query results.  Of course Hibernate has had this for
some time, although we had named ours `Query#stream` more in keeping with the choice made in most other
uses including most JDK uses.  But either way, both are available.. the JPA `javax.persistence.Query#getStream` and
Hibernate's `org.hibernate.query.Query#stream`.


=== Support Java 8 Date and Time API

Again, this is something Hibernate has already supported for quite some time.  But JPA 2.2 has made support for
the Java 8 date/time APIs part of the standard.



== Hibernate features

=== Caching and inheritance

5.3 adds the ability to enable/disable caching at any level within a mapped hierarchy.  This is a
change from previous versions that only allowed controlling caching on the root entity.  See
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12146[HHH-12146] for details


=== Java 9 module naming

Hibernate ORM jars now specify Java 9 module naming following the pattern `org.hibernate.orm.${module-name}`.
For example, the module name for `hibernate-core` is `org.hibernate.orm.core`; the module name for `hibernate-c3p0`
is `org.hibernate.orm.c3p0`; etc.


=== JpaCompliance

During bootstrapping a SessionFactory/EntityManagerFactory can be configured with a level of "JPA compliance"
that indicates what behaviors it should comply with JPA.  These are generally situations where Hibernate
has historically done something different or where we think the specification is not the best solution.
This `JpaCompliance` is used to control how Hibernate should act in these circumstances.  See
the javadocs for `org.hibernate.jpa.JpaCompliance` for details.


=== More intuitive handling of id generator names

Previously when Hibernate encountered a `@GeneratedValue` in relation to an identifier, it would assume that
there was a matching named generator annotation.  For example, if an application specified
`@GeneratedValue(strategy=TABLE, name="abc")` Hibernate would expect to see a `@TableGenerator`
or a `@org.hibernate.annotations.GenericGenerator` with the same name.  Which means that you'd often see
mappings like:

[source]
----
@Entity
public class AnEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=SEQUENCE, name="MY_SEQ")
    @SequenceGenerator(name="MY_SEQ", sequenceName="MY_SEQ")
    public Long getId() {...}

    ...
}
----

The `SequenceGenerator` in the above example adds no additional information and is really completely
unnecessary.  So Hibernate now recognizes the following mapping in exactly the same way as the above
mapping:


[source]
----
@Entity
public class AnEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=SEQUENCE, name="MY_SEQ")
    public Long getId() {...}

    ...
}
----



=== Vibur connection pool integration

The new `hibernate-vibur` module defines integration with the Vibur connection pool as a
`org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.spi.ConnectionProvider` implementation


== Bugs, tasks, miscellaneous

* Removed support for legacy HQL-style positional parameters
* Added Travis CI support
* Resume uploading Javadoc JARs to Maven
* Deprecate Environment-scoped settings
* Drop `hibernate-infinispan` module - relocated to `org.infinispan:infinispan-hibernate-cache`
