Yesterday I released the third candidate release for Hibernate ORM 5.0 (5.0.0.CR3).  We felt another CR was warranted
because we had some minor integration (SPI) work that we needed to make in to Final, but too much development had happened since
the second CR to be considered risk free to just include everything into Final.  At any rate CR3 got lots of great TLC :)  The 
complete set of changes can be seen in the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/20350[Jira changelog].  The
main changes include:


== Minor changes to the caching SPI

Essentially passing Session along to the various region access strategy methods to allow integrating with non-JDBC transactions.


== Work on schema tooling

Improved namespace (catalog/schema) support overall in schema tools.  Improved handling of views and synonyms for migrating and validating.


== Work on bytecode enhancement

Lots of fixes based on feedback.  


== Consistency in Transaction API

A few changes were made to the JDCB-based TransactionCoordinator to work more like in JTA environments.  Specifically:

* implemented support for marking the Transaction for rollback-only.
* transaction is now rolled back automatically on a failed commit.


== Work on the documentation

Besides updating the content, the content has been split into 3 separate guides:

* User Guide
* Domain Model Mapping Guide
* Integrations Guide


== How to get it

Additionally many other improvements and bugfixes are included.  See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/20150 for the complete list of changes.

The release tag is available at https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/releases/edit/5.0.0.CR3

As always, see https://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/ for information on obtaining the releases.
