We have just released <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH/fixforversion/11011" target="" class="regularLink">3.5.0-CR-2</a>.  The main focus for this release was bugfixes and documentation.

Please forgive the terseness of this entry.  I am quite tired :)

<p class="wikiPara">
Moving forward in the next 2 weeks we still have some documentation tasks to finish up and handle any bug reports that come back in to <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH" target="" class="regularLink">Jira</a>.  As we get closer to that time, we will decide whether <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH/fixforversion/11022" target="" class="regularLink">3.5.0.Next</a> becomes 3.5.0-CR-3 or 3.5.0-Final.</p>
