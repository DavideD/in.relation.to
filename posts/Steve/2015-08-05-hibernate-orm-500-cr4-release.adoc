Today I released a fourth candidate release for Hibernate ORM 5.0 (5.0.0.CR4).  The purpose was entirely to change the defaults
for some settings.  This allowed some additional fixes and additional documentation work to make it in.


== Default ImplicitNamingStrategy

The default ImplicitNamingStrategy (`hibernate.implicit_naming_strategy`) has changed to the JPA-compliant one.  Additionally
I added some short-names for the Hibernate-provided implementations.

* "default" -> org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyJpaCompliantImpl
* "jpa" -> org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyJpaCompliantImpl
* "legacy-jpa" -> org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyLegacyJpaImpl
* "legacy-hbm" -> org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyLegacyHbmImpl
* "component-path" -> org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyComponentPathImpl

The previous default was "legacy-jpa".  Existing applications that previously used the default naming strategy
and want to continue to use that implicit naming strategy should specify `hibernate.implicit_naming_strategy=legacy-jpa`
in their configuration settings.  Alternatively, they can call 
`MetadataBuilder#setImplicitNamingStrategy(ImplicitNamingStrategyLegacyJpaImpl.INSTANCE)`.


== Identifier generator mapping

Back in 3.6 I developed a new set of identifier generator strategies aimed at database portability based
on the JPA expectations for `@SequenceGenerator` and `@TableGenerator`.  Between 3.6 and now the default has been
to continue to use the legacy generator strategies, but we added a setting (`hibernate.id.new_generator_mappings`) 
to allow applications to request the newer strategies be used.  The default for this setting had been false. The 
default is now true.

Existing applications updating to CR4 and then Final that experience issues with identifier generator strategy selection 
should try setting this back to false if they wish to keep using the legacy mappings.


== Keyword auto-quoting

This is a new feature in 5.0, but previously the default had been to auto-quote any sql identifiers believed to be a 
keyword in the underlying database.  That feature has been disabled by default.

Applications that wish to use this feature should explicitly enable it by specifying `hibernate.auto_quote_keyword=true`
in their configuration settings.


== More work on the documentation

Still in progress, but alot more content has been added.


== How to get it

Additionally many other improvements and bugfixes are included.  See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/20752 for the complete list of changes.

The release tag is available at https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/releases/tag/5.0.0.CR4

As always, see https://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/ for information on obtaining the releases.
