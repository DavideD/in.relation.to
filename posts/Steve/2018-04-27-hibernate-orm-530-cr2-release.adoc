This is the second CR release for the Hibernate ORM 5.3 family.  5.3 represents a JPA 2.2 compatible version
on top of 5.2.  

CR1 was work done to verify against the JPA 2.2 TCK.  CR2 was, partially, work done based on the efforts 
of http://wildfly.org[WildFly] to certify against the full EE TCK, which has additional JPA-related tests.

The remainder of CR2 work mainly focused on binary compatibility for 5.3 with 5.1 and 5.2.  Most of that 
work has been done under https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-12424[HHH-12424] and its sub-tasks.  It 
was this work mainly that caused the delays in getting CR2 released.  I apologize for that delay, but this was
deemed a very important task.
