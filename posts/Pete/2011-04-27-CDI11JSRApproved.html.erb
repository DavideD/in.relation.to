<p class="wikiPara">
The JCP posted that the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=346" target="" class="regularLink">CDI 1.1 spec received almost unanimous approval</a> (everyone voted yes except VMWare, who didn't vote at all). The expert group has already started considering issues, and I would like to welcome anyone who has an interest in CDI to join. The homepage for CDI 1.1 development is <a href="https://github.com/pmuir/cdi/wiki" target="" class="regularLink">on github</a>, and provides a set of resources to get you started (more will be posted over time). A <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/CDI11" target="" class="regularLink">previous blog</a> covers what we hope to see improved in CDI 1.1.

We have a very low barrier to entry (<a href="https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/cdi-dev" target="" class="regularLink">join a mailing list</a>!) so I hope to see you there!</p>
