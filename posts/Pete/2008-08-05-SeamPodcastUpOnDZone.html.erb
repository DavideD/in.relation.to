DZone <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/whats-new-seam-21-an-interview?mz=3006-jboss" target="" class="regularLink">just posted</a> an interview with me about Seam.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
We spoke for a few minutes about Seam, and some of the features of Seam 2. Then we moved on to talk about the upcoming Seam 2.1, how it will support other view layers, and where JSF is going. Finally we spent a few minutes talking about Web Beans, and what it will mean for Seam users.
