DZone <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/core-seam?oid=hom6084" target="" class="regularLink">just published</a> a Seam reference card, by Seam committer <a href="http://solutionsfit.com/blog/" target="" class="regularLink">Jacob Orshalick</a>.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
I've long wanted one of these for Seam - Jacob does a great job of outlining the built in Seam components and how you can configure them in <tt>components.xml</tt>, as well as describing all the annotations and conversation management. He also provides a quick reference for <tt>seam-gen</tt>.

Check it out!</p>
