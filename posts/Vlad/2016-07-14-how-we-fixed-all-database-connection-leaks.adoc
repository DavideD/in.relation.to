= How we fixed all database connection leaks

== The context

By default, all Hibernate tests are run on http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2].
However, we have a lots of database-specific tests as well, so we should be testing on Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and possibly SQL Server as well.

When we tried to set up a Jenkins job that uses PostgreSQL, we realized that the job fails because we ran out of connections.
Knowing that the PostgreSQL server has a `max_connections` setting of 30, we realized the connection leak issue was significant.

== Needle in a haystack

Just the `hibernate-core` module alone has over 5000 tests, and `hibernate-envers` has around 2500 tests as well.
But there are many mode modules: `hibernate-c3p0`, `hibernate-ehcache`, `hibernate-jcache`, etc.
All in all, we couldn't just browse the code and spot issues.
We needed an automated connection leak detector.

That being said, I came up with https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-detect-database-connection-leaks/[a solution that works on H2, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL] as well.
Luckily, no problem was spotted in the actual framework code base.
All issues were caused by unit tests which did not handle database resources properly.

== The most common issues

One of the most widespread issue was caused by improper bootstrapping logic:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testInvalidMapping() {
    try {
        new MetadataSources( )
                .addAnnotatedClass( TheEntity.class )
                .buildMetadata();
        fail( "Was expecting failure" );
    }
    catch (AnnotationException ignore) {
    }
}
----

The issue here is that `MetadataSources` creates a `BootstrapServiceRegistry` behind the scenes, which in turn triggers the initialization of the underlying `ConnectionProvider`.
Without closing the `BootstrapServiceRegistry` explicitly, the `ConnectionProvider` will not get a chance to close all the currently pooled JDBC `Connection(s)`.

The fix is as simple as that:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testInvalidMapping() {
    MetadataSources metadataSources = new MetadataSources( )
        .addAnnotatedClass( TheEntity.class );
    try {
        metadataSources.buildMetadata();
        fail( "Was expecting failure" );
    }
    catch (AnnotationException ignore) {
    }
    finally {
        ServiceRegistry metaServiceRegistry = metadataSources.getServiceRegistry();
        if(metaServiceRegistry instanceof BootstrapServiceRegistry ) {
            BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder.destroy( metaServiceRegistry );
        }
    }
}
----

Another recurring issue was improper transaction handling such as in the following example:

[source,java]
----
protected void cleanup() {
    Session s = getFactory().openSession();
    s.beginTransaction();

    TestEntity testEntity = s.get( TestEntity.class, "foo" );
    Assert.assertTrue( testEntity.getParams().isEmpty() );

    TestOtherEntity testOtherEntity = s.get( TestOtherEntity.class, "foo" );
    Assert.assertTrue( testOtherEntity.getParams().isEmpty() );

    s.getTransaction().commit();
    s.clear();
    s.close();
}
----

The first thing to notice is the lack of a try/finally block which should be closing the session even if there is an exception being thrown.
But that's not all.

Not a long time ago, I had fixed https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-7412[HHH-7412], meaning that, for `RESOURCE_LOCAL` (e.g. JDBC `Connection`-bound transactions),
the https://vladmihalcea.com/a-beginners-guide-to-transaction-isolation-levels-in-enterprise-java/[logical or physical] `Connection` is closed only when the https://vladmihalcea.com/a-beginners-guide-to-acid-and-database-transactions/[transaction is ended] (either commit or rollback).

Before HHH-7412 was fixed, the `Connection` was closed automatically when the Hibernate `Session` was closed as well, but this behavior is not supported anymore.
Nowadays, aside from closing the underlying `Session`, you have to commit/rollback the current running `Transaction` as well:

[source,java]
----
protected void cleanup() {
    Session s = getFactory().openSession();
    s.beginTransaction();

    try {
        TestEntity testEntity = s.get( TestEntity.class, "foo" );
        Assert.assertTrue( testEntity.getParams().isEmpty() );

        TestOtherEntity testOtherEntity = s.get( TestOtherEntity.class, "foo" );
        Assert.assertTrue( testOtherEntity.getParams().isEmpty() );

        s.getTransaction().commit();
    }
    catch ( RuntimeException e ) {
        s.getTransaction().rollback();
        throw e;
    }
    finally {
        s.close();
    }
}

If you are curious of all the changes that were required, you can check the following two commits: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/commit/da9c6e160d6800a506fc1197db5caffb78382fba[da9c6e1] and https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/commit/f5e10c29ebf103df4de7ea7b528702f0d2d9fc2a[f5e10c2].
The good news is that the https://ci.hibernate.org/view/ORM/job/hibernate-orm-master-pgsql/[PostgreSQL job is running fine now], and soon we will add jobs for Oracle and a MySQL too.
