<p class="wikiPara">
With a wild 1.5 week behind us, I’m finally able to find some time to blog about the recent cool <a href="http://www.openblend.org" target="" class="regularLink">OpenBlend</a> conference.
</p>

<p class="wikiPara">
It was again nice attendee turn out, with very good 9 technical and 3 business presentations.
To finish it all off, for the first time, there was a cocktail party. Let me see if you can guess which cocktail belonged to certain major sponsor;  Shadowman, DeepBlue, VirtualBlend, IngredientX, BillyMo, Synergy and WarpDrive. :-)

<p class="wikiPara">
Conference pictures and presentations PDFs to follow asap.
