== Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.32.Final

Because of some internal changes in Hibernate ORM,
Hibernate Reactive will now need at least Hibernate ORM 5.4.32.Final.

Switching the dependencies shouldn't require any
additional changes to your project if you were already
using libraries in the same family version.

== How can I get it?

All details are available on the 
link:https://hibernate.org/reactive/releases/1.0/#get-it[Hibernate Reactive website releases page].

If you are new to Hibernate Reactive, the {getting-started}[the official documentation] is a good place to start.
