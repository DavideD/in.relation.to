Thank you!

== Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 5.4.31.Final

It's now possible to use Hibernate Reactive
with both Hibernate ORM 5.4 and Hibernate ORM 5.5.

The only drawback is that Hibernate Reactive
won't work with versions of Hibernate ORM
older than 5.4.31.Final.

== Reactive close

Nothing changes for applications using `withSession`
(http://hibernate.org/reactive/documentation/1.0/reference/html_single/#_obtaining_a_reactive_session[our reccomended approach]).

For everyone else, it's important to update the code
and to chain correctly operations following a `Session#close`.

The signature of `Mutiny.Session#close` is now:
```
Uni<Void> close();
```

and for `Stage.Session#close`:
```
CompletionStage<Void> close();
```

Because of this, the reactive session doesn't implement the
interface `Autoclosable` anymore.

== How can I get it?

All details are available on the 
link:https://hibernate.org/reactive/releases/1.0/#get-it[Hibernate Reactive website releases page].

If you are new to Hibernate Reactive, the {getting-started}[the official documentation] is a good place to start.
