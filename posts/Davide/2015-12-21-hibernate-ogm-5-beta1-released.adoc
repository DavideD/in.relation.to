It's 3 days from Christmas and as a present we decided to release the first Beta of https://hibernate.org/ogm/[Hibernate OGM] 5!

The major news in this release is the mapping support for http://cassandra.apache.org[Cassandra] 2.2 new data types,
proper handling of the @Lob annotation, post-load event support 
and http://infinispan.org[Infinispan 8].

This release also continue the process of aligning Hibernate OGM to the Hibernate 5 family.
After the passage to Hibernate ORM 5 in the previous release, we updated https://hibernate.org/search/[Hibernate Search]
to the 5.5 version that also includes the power of https://lucene.apache.org[Apache Lucene 5].


http://in.relation.to/2015/08/24/redis-support-hibernate-orm5-update-hibernate-ogm-50-alpha1-released/[In the previous
release post] we described the improvements about storing map-typed properties on MongoDB and Redis.
We have now applied the same natural mapping on CouchDB.

Check out the Hibernate OGM https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/HibernateOGMMigrationNotes[migration notes]
to learn more about migrating from earlier versions of Hibernate OGM to 5.x.

== Cassandra 2.2 new data types

Take advantage of the http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/datastax-java-driver-2-2-0-rc1-released[new data types provided by Cassandra 2.2]:

* _date_ for properties mapped using `@Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)`
* _time_ for properties mapped using `@Temporal(TemporalType.TIME)`
* _tinyint_ for `java.lang.Byte`
* _smallint_ for `java.lang.Short`

== PostLoad event support

Thanks to David Williams contribution, the `@PostLoad` annotation will now work with Hibernate OGM.

If you are not familiar with this annotation, it's part of the JPA spec and it allows to specify
callback methods for the corresponding lifecycle event.

[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class Zoo {

   @Id
   private Integer id;

   @ElementCollection
   private Set<Animal> animals = new HashSet<Animal>();

   private int nrOfAnimals;

   ...

   @PostLoad
   public void postLoad() {
       nrOfAnimals = animals.size();
   }
}
----

The `postLoad()` method will be called after all the eagerly fetched fields of the class `Zoo` 
have been loaded from the datastore allowing us to inizialize the value of the attribute
`nrOfElement`.

Note that this code follows the JPA spec and it could be use in the same way with Hibernate ORM
or any other JPA compliant project.

== How can I add support for a new data store?

I'm glad you ask, community member https://twitter.com/mp911de[Mark Paluch] contributed to the
documentation adding a new section that explains the different components involved in the creation
of a new backend: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/ogm/5.0/reference/en-US/html/ch01.html#how_to_build_support_for_a_data_store[How to build support for a data store]

== What's coming next?

The major features we are planning to include in the next release are the support for the Neo4j
remote server and an alternative dialect for Redis which persists values right into hash fields.

== Where can I get it?

You can retrieve Hibernate OGM 5.0.0.Beta1 via Maven etc. using the following coordinates:

* _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-core:5.0.0.Beta1_ for the Hibernate OGM core module
* _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-<%BACKEND%>:5.0.0.Beta1_ for the NoSQL backend you want to use, with _<%BACKEND%>_ being one of "mongodb", "redis", "neo4j" etc.

Alternatively, you can download archives containing all the binaries, source code and documentation from SourceForge.

As always, we are looking forward to your feedback. The https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm/blob/5.0.0.Beta1/changelog.txt[change log] tells in detail what's in there for you.
