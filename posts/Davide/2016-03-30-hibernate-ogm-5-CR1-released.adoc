We are getting closer and closer to the final release of https://hibernate.org/ogm/[Hibernate OGM] 5.

This release includes support for http://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial[Redis Cluster] and
a new dialect to store data within http://redis.io[Redis] hashes; `java.util.UUID` are now
using the native `uuid` type in http://cassandra.apache.org[Apache Cassandra];
more queries are now supported using the https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] CLI syntax.

This release is also aligned to the Hibernate 5 family and it will work with https://hibernate.org/orm[Hibernate ORM] 5,
https://hibernate.org/search[Hibernate Search] 5.5 and the latest http://wildfly.org/[WildFly] 10.
Check the http://in.relation.to/2015/12/21/hibernate-ogm-5-beta1-released[previous post] for more details about it.

The https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/HibernateOGMMigrationNotes[migration notes]
contains more information about migrating from earlier versions of Hibernate OGM to 5.x.

Have a look at the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-ogm/blob/5.0.0.CR1/changelog.txt[change log] for a list
of everything included in this release.

== Redis Cluster support

Enabling the support for Redis Cluster is a matter of setting the following property to `true`:

[source]
----
hibernate.ogm.redis.cluster = true
----

When this property is enabled, data will be stored across Redis cluster nodes according to the
http://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec#keys-distribution-modelbased[Redis key distribution model]
on the hash slot of the key of each entity.

Check the documentation for more details about the
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/ogm/5.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#ogm-redis-configuration[configuration options for Redis] in Hibernate OGM.

== Redis hash mapping

When using this mapping, data is stored using key-values pairs using Redis hashes. The benefit of
this approach is that it allows partial updates.

You can enable this dialect setting the following property:

[source]
----
hibernate.ogm.datastore.grid_dialect = org.hibernate.ogm.datastore.redis.RedisHashDialect
----

This will map the following entity:

[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class News {

    @Id
    private String id;

    @Version
    @Column(name="version")
    private int version;

    private String title;

    private String description;

    //getters, setters ...
}
----

with the following properties:

[source]
----
version     = 1
title       = On the merits of NoSQL
description = This paper discuss why NoSQL will save the world for good
----

A huge thanks to community member https://twitter.com/mp911de[Mark Paluch], responsible for both
these great improvements in the Redis area. Note that these features are both experimental for the
time being.

== Additional MongoDB native CLI queries support

Thanks to the contribution of https://github.com/twwwt[Thorsten MÃ¶ller], Hibernate OGM now supports
more type of queries using the MongoDB CLI syntax: _findOne_, _findAndModify_, _insert_, _remove_ and _update_.

Here an example showing how you can use them:

[source, java]
----
OgmSession session = ...

String nativeQuery = "db.OscarWilde.findAndModify({"
        + "'query': {'author': 'oscarwilde'}, "
        + "'update': { '$set': { 'author': 'Oscar Wilder' } }, "
        + "'new': true "
        + "})";

Query query = session.createNativeQuery( nativeQuery ).addEntity( OscarWilde.class );
List<OscarWilde> result = query.list();
----

You can find more details in the documentation about experimental
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/ogm/5.0/reference/en-US/html/ch11.html#ogm-mongodb-queries-native[support of native MongoDB queries].

== What's coming next?

We are working on the Neo4j remote dialect and we are focused on releasing a stable version of
Hibernate OGM 5.

== Where can I get it?

You can get Hibernate OGM 5.0.0.CR1 via Maven etc. using the following coordinates:

* _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-core:5.0.0.CR1_ for the Hibernate OGM core module
* _org.hibernate.ogm:hibernate-ogm-<%BACKEND%>:5.0.0.CR1 for the NoSQL backend you want to use, with _<%BACKEND%>_ being one of "mongodb", "redis", "neo4j", etc.

Alternatively, you can download archives containing all the binaries, source code and documentation https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-ogm/5.0.0.CR1[from SourceForge].

== How can I get in touch?

You can get in touch through the following channels:

* https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=31[User forum]
* https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/OGM[Issue tracker]
* http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/hibernate-dev/[Mailing list]
* http://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow]: we monitor the tag _hibernate-ogm_

We are looking forward to hear your feedback!
