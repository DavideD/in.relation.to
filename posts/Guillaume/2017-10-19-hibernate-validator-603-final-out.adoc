And here comes another maintenance release of Hibernate Validator 6.0.

A lot of thanks to our users and contributors for reporting issues and submitting pull requests, it was definitely a great team effort.

This is a recommended upgrade for everyone using Hibernate Validator 6.0.x and it is a drop-in replacement of 6.0.2.Final.

== What's new

=== Towards a `ScriptEvaluatorFactory` SPI

https://github.com/marko-bekhta[Marko Bekhta] worked tirelessly on making the `@ScriptAssert` and `@ParameterScriptAssert` constraints more flexible.

We had several goals in mind:

 * Allow to use these features in OSGi environments (we had class loader issues before)
 * Make it possible to use scripting engines not based on JSR 223 (e.g. Spring EL)
 * Instantiate a separate `ScriptEvaluatorFactory` per `ValidatorFactory`, whereas it was a static singleton before

Using this new SPI, you can define a specific `ScriptEvaluatorFactory` either in the XML configuration:
[source,xml]
----
<validation-config
        xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/validation/configuration"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/validation/configuration
            http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/validation/configuration/validation-configuration-2.0.xsd"
        version="2.0">

    <property name="hibernate.validator.script_evaluator_factory">
        org.hibernate.validator.referenceguide.chapter09.CustomScriptEvaluatorFactory
    </property>

</validation-config>
----

or via the programmatic API:
[source,java]
----
Validator validator = Validation.byProvider( HibernateValidator.class )
        .configure()
        .scriptEvaluatorFactory(
                new CustomScriptEvaluatorFactory()
        )
        .buildValidatorFactory()
        .getValidator();
----

You can find other examples in https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-script-evaluator-factory[our documentation], most notably examples allowing to use `@ScriptAssert` and `@ParameterScriptAssert` with SpEL (Spring Expression Language) or in OSGi environments.

This new SPI is marked as incubating for now. Feedback welcome!

=== New `@CodePointLength` constraint

This new constraint was contributed by https://github.com/kazuki43zoo[Kazuki Shimizu]. It allows to add limits to the code point length of a char sequence:

[source,java]
----
@CodePointLength(min = 1, max = 10, normalizationStrategy = NormalizationStrategy.NFD)
private String text = "„Åå";
----

=== Performance and memory allocation improvements

We made another round of performance and memory allocation improvements. Hibernate Validator should be faster than ever!

One thing worth mentioning is that, if you use a custom `TraversableResolver`, it is now possible to disable the `TraversableResolver` result cache. The caching adds some overhead and, if your `TraversableResolver` is fast, you don't need it. More information can be found in https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-validator-factory-traversable-resolver[our documentation]

=== OSGi support improvements

Apart from the `ScriptEvaluatorFactory` SPI, we also made other OSGi improvements.

The OSGi manifest for our CDI module was incorrect and, with the help of https://github.com/arjantijms[Arjan Timjs], we were able to fix it and add an integration test.

=== Documentation improvements

We made a few improvements to the documentation regarding:

 * the container element constraint feature,
 * the JDK 9 support.

=== Full changelog

The complete list of fixed issues can be found https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20HV%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20{released-version}%20order%20by%20created%20DESC[on our JIRA].

== Getting 6.0.3.Final

To get the release with Maven, Gradle etc. use the GAV coordinates _org.hibernate.validator:{hibernate-validator|hibernate-validator-cdi|hibernate-validator-annotation-processor}:{released-version}_. Note that the group id has changed from `org.hibernate` (Hibernate Validator 5 and earlier) to `org.hibernate.validator` (from Hibernate Validator 6 onwards).

Alternatively, a distribution bundle containing all the bits is provided on SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/{released-version}/hibernate-validator-{released-version}-dist.tar.gz/download[TAR.GZ], http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-validator/{released-version}/hibernate-validator-{released-version}-dist.zip/download[ZIP]).

If you want to benefit from the new features of this version on WildFly, we also provide WildFly patches for http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/hibernate/validator/hibernate-validator-modules/{released-version}/hibernate-validator-modules-{released-version}-wildfly-10.1.0.Final-patch.zip[WildFly 10.1] and http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/hibernate/validator/hibernate-validator-modules/{released-version}/hibernate-validator-modules-{released-version}-wildfly-11.0.0.CR1-patch.zip[WildFly 11.0 CR1] (wait for the synchronization to Maven Central). You can read about how to apply such patches http://in.relation.to/2017/04/04/testing-bean-validation-2-0-on-wildfly-10/[here].

== Maintenance releases for the 5.3 and 5.4 branches

We also released 5.3.6.Final and 5.4.2.Final with updated JDK 9 support and a fix for https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7536[CVE-2017-7536] - which only affects users relying on the security manager.

== What's next?

We will continue to release maintenance releases to fix quickly the issues reported by our users.

We updated https://hibernate.org/validator/roadmap/[our roadmap] with the ideas we have for the future. If you want to join us, don't hesitate to pick a task and come discuss it with us.
